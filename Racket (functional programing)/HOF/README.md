# HOF - Higher Order Functions
The high order functions are used to quickly and efficiently go through a list or tree using recursion.

My task was to implement following functions (just with functional programming paradigm):
- **foldr** - folding function that goes through list from right
- **foldl** - folding function that goes through list from left
- **fold tree** - folding function that goes through an n-tree
Using the above:
- **map** - modifies each element specified by the function
- **reduce** - goes through the list and applies the specified binary function
- **filter** - removes elements from the list that fulfill the specified function

- **merge sort** - with comparator as parameter
- **quick sort** - with comparator as parameter


_HighOrderFunctions_ - main source file\
_assert.rkt_ - functions that allow asserting

You will find sample inputs and outputs under each function in the form of an assert.
